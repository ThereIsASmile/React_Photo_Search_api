Photo Search API using unsplash.com <br>
Looks good on mobile screen sizes.<br>
Used CSS Grid for image show layout.<br>
Would like to come back and align images better... Maybe filter out all landscape sizes and group together and filter out all portrait sizes and group together... <br>
This project was created coding along with Stephen Grider's Modern React with Redux [2023 Update] but content, images, and styling were changed.<br>
